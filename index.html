              An Experience that changed my Life Life is full of learning and it is
              mostly due to our daily life experiences. These experiences are mostly
              based on our surrounding environment from where we learn new things
              every day. But all these experiences are a result of our keen
              observations out of daily routines. It is very important to note that
              life also provides us with some chances to experience new people or
              places that are indeed out of the ordinary. That is the time we indeed
              learn new and unique

              Designing One’s Life to Create Others’ Experiences Throughout the
              world, the voice of Andrea Bocelli permeates the ears of millions of
              people in multiple countries leaving all who hear with fond memories.
              Boasting of more than 80 million record sales around the world,
              Bocelli’s music tops classical and pop charts. Though, while Bocelli
              started his singing career during his childhood, even winning a
              singing competition at the age of 14, his professional singing career
              did not start until after
